usps_intelligent_barcode is a pure ruby gem to generate a USPS IMB
(Intelligent Mail Barcode).  More specifically, it generates the
string of characters you should print using one of the [USPS
Intelligent Barcode
fonts](https://ribbs.usps.gov/onecodesolution/download.cfm).

# Origin

This project was forked from Ryan Taylor's
https://github.com/rtlong/USPS-intelligent-barcode Long, in order to
add tests and refactor.  It is _not_ a drop-in replacement: I renamed
most methods and classes, and eliminated the #draw method.

# Install

    $ gem install USPS-intelligent-barcode

# Example

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'usps_intelligent_barcode'
    
    barcode_id = '01'
    service_type = '234'
    mailer_id = '567094'
    serial_number = '987654321'
    routing_code = '01234567891'
    barcode = Imb::Barcode.new(barcode_id,
                               service_type,
                               mailer_id,
                               serial_number,
                               routing_code)
    p barcode.barcode_letters
    # => "AADTFFDFTDADTAADAATFDTDDAAADDTDTTDAFADADDDTFFFDDTTTADFAAADFTDAADA"

Thanks to Ryan Taylor Long for his original work, without which I
